## Optimizing Sales Incrementality on Retail Platforms

Retail platforms offer a vast marketplace for brands, but competition is fierce. Accurately measuring the incremental impact of marketing efforts on these platforms is crucial for maximizing sales without overspending. 

**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to develop a robust model to predict the incremental sales generated by various marketing strategies on retail platforms. This will ultimately increase clients' overall sales by optimizing marketing spend allocation.

**Approach:**

* **Data Extraction:** Beautiful Soup was utilized to extract relevant sales data from retail websites.
* **Data Integration:** Customer Relationship Management (CRM) data was integrated to get a holistic view of customer interactions.
* **Scalable Data Management:** Google BigQuery was leveraged for scalable data storage and management.
* **Distributed Data Processing:** Spark was used for distributed data processing tasks to extract meaningful insights from the combined datasets.
* **Feature Engineering:** Customer segmentation and product category encoding were explored to create robust features for model training.
* **Model Building:** TensorFlow was leveraged to build a deep learning model (RNNs) to learn complex relationships within the data.
* **Model Evaluation:** A/B testing was implemented to rigorously test the model's performance.
* **Deployment and Scalability:** Google Cloud AI Platform was used to ensure scalability and easy integration with client workflows.
* **Model Integration:** Finally, the model was integrated with marketing automation platforms for real-time campaign optimization and budget allocation recommendations.


**Results:**

The project achieved significant results:

* A 30% increase in clients' incremental sales on several retail platforms.
* Enhanced market budget allocation efficiency by predicting the true impact of various strategies.
* Gained deeper customer insight by understanding how different marketing tactics influence purchase behavior across varied platforms.
